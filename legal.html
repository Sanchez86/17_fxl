                                    365binaryoption will reimburse the trader with bonus funds to their account balance. The value of the bonus is determined by the total loss
                                    from all insured trades and will in no event exceed the value of the funding deposit. If at any point a trader withdraws the initial deposit

                            When using 365binaryoption, or any online trading site, there are measures each trader should take to ensure their personal security:

                                        We highly recommend that traders take extensive precautions to ensure that their usernames and passwords are not seen by any
                                        unauthorized  persons. FXLeader trader passwords are encrypted and cannot be seen by any FXLeader personnel or staff.
                                        FXLeader will under no circumstances ask a client to disclose their password. Any such request should be viewed by traders as a
                                        security breech and immediately reported to the customer care centre.
                                    </p>

                                        FXLeader recommends that traders use a combination of characters and digits that are hard to be deciphered. Traders would also be
                                        well-advised to periodically request a new password in order to maintain maximum security. If at any point a trader comes to believe that
                                        their  password’s security has been compromised, they should immediately contact FXLeader’s customer care centre and change
                                        their password.
                                    </p>
