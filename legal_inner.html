                                                    maintain an account by means of telegraphic deposits, profits withdrawals

                                    Abuse of the System or manipulation of Transactions<br>
                                    Should you execute trading strategies acting in bad faith, that is, you or any
                                    representative of yours trading on your behalf is committing any improper or abusive trading
                                    act such as for example: fraud/illegal actions that led to the transaction; orders placed
                                    based on manipulated prices as a result of system errors or system malfunctions; arbitrage
                                    trading on prices offered by our platforms as a result of systems errors; and/or coordinated
                                    transactions by related parties in order to take advantage of systems errors and delays on
                                    systems updates.<br>
                                    Then the Company will have the right to: (i) adjust the price spreads available to you;

                                    during our trading relationship; and/or (iv) reject an order or to cancel a trade; and/or
                                    (v) immediately terminate our trading relationship.

                                    The parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a settlement to any claim or dispute between

                                    terms of settlement, either side may submit the dispute to confidential arbitration proceedings
                                    by a sole arbitrator under the ICC ADR Rules, whose decision shall be final and binding. The
                                    arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English, in London, UK or another place agreed by
                                    Parties. Without derogating of the provisions above, this clause explicitly sets exclusive
                                    jurisdiction to said arbitration process, and neither Party shall be entitled to submit any
                                    dispute to the courts of its domicile which contradicts said arbitration process.
